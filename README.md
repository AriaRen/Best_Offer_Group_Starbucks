## installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Customers could react totally different towards certain offers from sellers. Proper marketing strategies can help raise sales tremendously. However, if you provide every member with a discount offer, it could even cut your profits since part of your consumers, most likely the high-income loyal group, never check coupon before spending money in your store. Therefore, getting know your customers and selecting discount-driven ones tend to be highly crucial. 

How can we get target customer group? How can we decide on whether a transaction was motivated by a coupon? How does the target group look like? Driven by those questions, I started a data science project using simulated historical offer data sets provided by Starbucks. 

## File Description
There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above subject. All of the questions are solved. The Python script includes data and package loading, exploratory analysis, data cleaning, transformation to solve problems and whole process of building unsupervised predictive models, K-means Clustering. Every step was written in a function to make codes modular. 

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rensiningaria/how-to-get-target-customers-by-analyzing-historical-offer-da707717d8a4).
